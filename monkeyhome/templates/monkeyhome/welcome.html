            Remember the simple joy of two monkeys throwing snowballs at each other? 
            In the late 2000s, <strong>Monkey Snowfight</strong> by Niclas Åberg captured hearts worldwide 
            with its delightfully chaotic multiplayer battles.

            <p class="welcome__description">
                This project is my tribute to that beloved game. While the original had chat features 
                that were "quickly removed for obvious reasons," I saw an opportunity to reimagine 
                what a Monkey Snowfight community could look like with proper moderation and design.
            </p>
            
            <p class="welcome__description">
                What started as nostalgia became a full-featured real-time chat ecosystem. 
                The game recreation is still a work in progress, but the heart of the community—
                the chat, the connections, the playful spirit—is alive and thriving.
